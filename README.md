# Coding Challenge from Blueprint

1. Link to the hosted application: [https://myapp-blueprint.herokuapp.com/](https://myapp-blueprint.herokuapp.com/)

2. Description of the problem and solution: A web application with an assessment interface for users to complete. It guides users through a series of questions, records their answers, and sends the data to an endpoint for mental disorder diagnosis based on question mappings.

3. Reasoning behind technical choices: Django for its simplicity and robustness, Heroku for easy deployment and scalability, JSON for lightweight and human-readable storage of small data sets.

4. Deployment as a production app: Set up a GitHub repository, configure environment variables and API keys, handle static files, and deploy on Heroku using Git push. Consider adding a compatible database addon and scaling options.

5. Ensuring high availability and performance: Set up scaling options on Heroku, implement caching mechanisms (e.g., Django's caching framework or Redis), optimize database queries, and consider a content delivery network (CDN) for static file caching.

6. Security measures: Implement HTTPS for secure communication, user authentication and authorization, and input validation and sanitization.

7. Improving troubleshooting: Implement comprehensive error handling and logging, use a monitoring service, and consider implementing feature flags for controlled testing and debugging.

8. Trade-offs and future improvements: Consider different web frameworks and database storage options based on project requirements. Enhancements can be made to UI design, error handling, and testing.
